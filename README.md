# WifiPrinter

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bertmelis/WifiPrinter.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bertmelis/WifiPrinter)

Arduino library for ESP8266 and ESP32 to print on a device-hosted webpage via websockets.

The webpage also displays some basic statistics and features an upload form for firmware updates.

**Warning:** the webserver is completely unprotected. Do not use in public environments!

Developement takes place in the `redesign` branch.
If you wanted to have the old lib, please visit the [RemoteDebug repo](https://github.com/JoaoLopesF/RemoteDebug).
